# TSDZ2 female cap

3D printable cap for TSDZ2 6-pin male cable. 3d prints are not fully watertight so for full protection I also recommend to put duct tape and then cover with electrical tape (for aesthetics). 

I designed this in tinkercad but will start using blender to design future 3d prints.

todo: is this a public link as well?

I made the outer cylinder 8.5mm and I have added two files, one with where the hole is 6.5mm and one where it is 6.75mm.
