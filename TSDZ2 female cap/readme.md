# TSDZ2 female cap

3D printable cap for TSDZ2 6-pin male cable. 3d prints are not fully watertight so for full protection I also recommend to put duct tape and then cover with electrical tape (for aesthetics). 

I designed this in tinkercad but will start using blender to design future 3d prints.

I made the outer cylinder 8.5mm and I have added two files, one with where the hole is 6.5mm and one where it is 6.75mm. I have a couple of different cables and on most of them the 6.5mm hole one was a little to tight and I was worried that it would damage the plastic so therefor a made a 6.75mm version.

The T in the name is for how big I made the "rectangle" for the flat part of the connector, I found that 1.25mm worked the best for this.
